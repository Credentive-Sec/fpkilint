## Privacy Policy

### IDManagement.gov Privacy Policy

General Services Administration's (GSA) websites automatically collect basic system performance and visitor volume metrics. GSA uses this information to help develop its websites, analyze patterns of usage, address problem areas, and make the sites more useful for you. 

When you visit IDManagement.gov, we may store some or all of the following:

*	Internet protocol (IP) address from which you accessed one of our websites <**Doesn't this somewhat expose the user's identity?**>
*	Date and time of your visit
*	Name of the file or words you searched <**Doesn't this somewhat expose the user's identity?**>
*	Items clicked on a page <**Doesn't this somewhat expose the user's identity?**>
*	Browser and operating system used
* Name of the website from which you linked to IDmanagement.gov <**Doesn't this somewhat expose the user's identity?**>

We do not use this information to associate search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We do not share or sell visitor data for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose.

### Information You Send Us <**Originally from IDM.gov with change to "CPCT." Include?**>

The CPCT website does not collect personal information unless you choose to provide it, such as by sending us an email. We only use the information you provide us to respond to a request. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We do not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or by statute.

### Use of Cookies <**From IDM.gov. Include?**>

<**From IDM.gov Privacy Policy page with edit; could be left out.**> Like many websites, IDManagement.gov uses “persistent cookie” technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that the website places on your web browser so that it can gather anonymous summary information and remember your browser when it is used to visit our site again later. These cookies uniquely identify a browser on a computer, but never a person.  Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don’t want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Here’s how you can [disable cookies](https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions){:target="_blank"}.

### Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT) Privacy Policy

Under IDManagement.gov’s Privacy Policy, your privacy as a CPCT user is protected. The information that you provide or generate when using CPCT is protected under CPCT's additional privacy policy:

* No uploaded certificates are saved.  
* No certificate profile test results are saved.  
* Your identity information is not saved. <**Is the CPCT privacy policy stricter about not collecting user information?  IDM.gov's Privacy Policy says IDM.gov may collect IP addresses, search criteria, what you clicked on, which site you navigated from to IDM, etc.**>

### Questions or Comments?

If you have Privacy Policy questions or comments, please email us at **icam@gsa.gov**. We’ll make every effort to respond to your email as quickly as possible.  [Use **fpki@gsa.gov** instead?]
