### IDManagement.gov Privacy Policy
The General Services Administration’s (GSA) collects basic system performance and visitor volume metrics. GSA uses this information to help develop the site, analyze patterns of usage, address problem areas, and make the site more useful for you. 
When you visit IDManagement.gov, we may store some or all of the following:
•	Internet protocol (IP) address from which you accessed the site
•	Date and time of your visit
•	Name of the file or words you searched
•	Items clicked on a page
•	Browser and operating system used
•	Name of the website from which you linked to IDmanagement.gov
We do not use this information to associate search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We do not share or sell visitor data for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose.
[This IDM para. could be left out.] Like many websites, IDManagement.gov uses “persistent cookie” technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that the website places on your web browser so that it can gather anonymous summary demographic information and remember your browser when it is used to visit our site again later. These cookies uniquely identify a browser on a computer, but never a person. 
[This IDM para. could be left out.] Persistent cookies disablement could be left in.] Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don’t want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Here’s how you can disable cookies.
